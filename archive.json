One of the things identified as missing is links between networks, as links can belong to 1 network only. We modelled IS-IS areas as networks in our PoC and there was an issue how to model the links between different OSPF areas. We added network-id as ref as well for the destination . IS-IS model can be changed to have OSPF areas as networks when RFC8345 is improved, the effort has started to come up with drafts to propose backward compatible solutions for all of the things identified as missing from RFC8345. The links between the networks will be one of the proposals.\r\n\r\nThe following is the text from the draft-havel-opsawg-digital-map-00 draft:\r\n[6.1.3. ][Links Between Networks]\r\nThe RFC8345 defines all links as belonging to one network instance and having the source and destination as node and termination point only, not allowing to link to termination point of another network. This does not allow for links between networks in the case of multi-domains or partitioning. The only way would be to model each domain as node and have links between them.\r\n\r\nWe modelled OSPF and IS-IS Areas as networks during the PoC and we needed to extend the capability to have links between different areas. We added network reference as well to the source / destination of the link. The RFC8795 also augments links with external-domain info for the case of links that connect different domains.",

Please see below some suggested writing:\r\n\r\nThe standardization of the NBI of SDN controllers for IP networks, permits the connection of third party tools covering specialized cases. Among them, the tools for network performance optimization, and network dimensioning and planning would benefit from retrieving from the NBI an abstracted view of the IP network topology and IGP configurations. \r\n\r\nAs for IS-IS, the NBI should export enough information to permit these tools simulating the IP routing at a macroscopic flow level. That is, simulating how IP-level traffic demands would be forwarded, after ISIS convergence is reached, and from there estimating, using appropriate mathematical models, related KPIs like the occupation in the links or end-to-end latencies. \r\n\r\nBeing able to simulate the IP demands routing, enables multiple use cases like:\r\n\r\n* What-if analysis. Estimation of the network KPIs in modified network situations. For instance, failure situations, traffic anomaly situations, addition or deletion of new adjacencies, IGP weight reconfigurations.\r\n* Failure analysis. Systematic and massive test of the network under multiple simulated failure situations, evaluating the network fault tolerance properties, and using mathematical models to derive statistical network availability metrics.\r\n* Network design & capacity planning. Dimensioning or redesign of the IP infrastructure to satisfy target KPI metrics under existing or forecasted traffic demands.\r\n\r\n",
